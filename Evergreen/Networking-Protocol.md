A [[Protocol]] in the context of networking is a set of rules on how to format data, and processing data. Defining these rules are important to enabling communications between two entities. 

Without a set rules to consistently format the outbound info, the receiving entity would have a much more difficult time processing information. Without a set of instructions the other user would have to figure out how to process information.

A set format and official instructions based on how data is formatted when sent, makes receiving data, and makes processing information easy, predictable and consistent.

## Analogy
This of it as a speaking language. In the scenario of different languages speakers, communicated information would be a cypher making communication very difficult. You wouldn't know how to communicate the information in a way the other person can under and process it.

If both two people speak different languages, but both understand Chinese, then they can communicate with one another. 

In the case of computers each computer speaks it's own language, but both knows how to communicate in a 3rd language allowing for communication.

### Examples:
1. If one computer knows the internet protocol and the other computer does as well they'll be able to communicate
2. In the united nations communicate is relied upon 6 languages, which is used in order for all members of different countries with different languages to be able to communicate with another.
3. If one computer use the IP, and the other does not the other computer wouldn't under IP therefore communication would not be possible.

Like in speech, in networking there are so many different languages, for specific scenarios which is truly enables computers with different hardware and software to communicate regardless.
