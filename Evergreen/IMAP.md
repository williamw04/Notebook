IMAP is a [[Protocol]] used to access your emails from any device. It doesn't actually down or store the email on your device, but reads it from a server. Only when you click on an email, you down downloads the message, excluding any other attachments and images etc..., which is faster than alternatives such as POP.

Google also supports IMAP for third party services looking to access a user's emails [[IMAP- Setting Up and Parsing Gmail]]
