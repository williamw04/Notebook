The site has a form element with with attributes:

action='/examppleapp/new_note' method='POST'
This says what address the form is going to contact and that it makes a POST request which is a request to store information on a database.

Within the form element is two input elements. 
The first one has attributes type='text' which is going to be a header explaing the content type so the server knows how to handle the body of the request/the data.

The Second one submits the data.
