The topmost node of the DOM tree of an HTML document is called the _document_ object. We can perform various operations on a webpage using the DOM-API. You can access the _document_ object by typing _document_ into the Console tab:

MY THOUGHTS: I'm guess the dom object gives you access to all the elements since it's the top most node in a tree and can therefore traverse to any element. However, it's called the document object the top most node of a DOM tree of an html odcument (what a mouth full). It allows us to use the DOM-API to perform various operation.
