 You cannot render objects directly in JSX since react is unable to. In React, individual things in  curly brackets {} must be primitives since that's what react can handle.
 
 (If you try rendering objects it will spit the error: Objects are not valid as React Child)
 
 Examples Below:

Not Allowed:
```js
const App = () => {
  const friends = [
    { name: 'Peter', age: 4 },
    { name: 'Maya', age: 10 },
  ]

  return (
    <div>
      <p>{friends[0]}</p>
      <p>{friends[1]}</p>
    </div>
  )
}

export default App
```

Allowed: 
```js
const App = () => {
  const friends = [
    { name: 'Peter', age: 4 },
    { name: 'Maya', age: 10 },
  ]

  return (
    <div>
      <p>{friends[0].name} {friends[0].age}</p>
      <p>{friends[1].name} {friends[1].age}</p>
    </div>
  )
}

export default App
```

Note that although arrays are treated as objects, under certain circumstances arrays containing primitive values (values that are allowed to be rendered) can be evaluated inside curly braces. 

To add on an array of primitives can also be passed as a prop into a component, but also objects can. It's just that if an object is passed as a prop into another component, in that component it's properities can be rendered and the object itself unless  you do something like below.
```js
<p>{JSON.stringify(friends[0])}</p>  // Renders: {"name":"Peter","age":4}
```

Takeways:
- JSX cannot directly render objects
- Can only render primitives
- Arrays can be rendered if they contain primitive values
- Objects and arrays can be passed as props into a component since arrays are treated as objects.
