You can define multiple components in a single file

Below modify App.jsx as follows: We defined a new component Hello and is used inside the app component.
```javascript
const Hello = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <p>Hello world</p>
    </div>
  )
}

const App = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Greetings</h1>

      <Hello />
    </div>
  )
}
```

The Hello component can be used many times like so: Note that the hello tag is closed everytime. It appears to used components you define them as single tags and the name. 
```js
const App = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Greetings</h1>
      <Hello />
      <Hello />
      <Hello />
    </div>
  )
}
```

Takeaways:
	- Can define multiple components within a component. The catch is that you can import one and use the other define components in each other.
	- Gaining experience with using components in other components.
