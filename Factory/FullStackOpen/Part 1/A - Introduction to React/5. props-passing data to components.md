You can pass data into components using props

In the case below: we update hello to take in objects. Now in all the {} curly brackets imbedded into the mark-up, all the props are evaluated for each 
```js
const Hello = (props) => {  return (
    <div>
      <p>Hello {props.name}</p>    
    </div>
  )
}
```

and updating the app component app.tsx looks like this 
```js
const Hello = (props) => {

  console.log(props)
  return (
    <div>
      <p>

        Hello {props.name}, you are {props.age} years old
      </p>
    </div>
  )
}

const App = () => {

  const name = 'Peter'
  const age = 10

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Greetings</h1>

      <Hello name='Johnny' age={26 + 10} />
      <Hello name={name} age={age} />
    </div>
  )
}
export default App

```

we can see that now the hello prop will take in a object and this object will need to have attributes name and age. Where it's used in the app component we can see in the tags with Hello, each of them has a name and age attribute which we know is being passed into the app Hello as a prop.

In this first tag we see that name is set to johnny and age is in curly brackets {} meaning it will dynamically be evaluated when compiled (age will be equal to 36)
```js
      <Hello name='Johnny' age={26 + 10} />
```

In this second tag now name and age are also being passed but both are being set to {name} and {age} respectively. We know from the power of react components that this is dynamically creating the html since the curly brackets will be evaluating and inserted and we see in vanilla javascript above that name and age are declared to 'Peter' and 10 respectively. So the prop object being passed will have attributes name='Peter and age=10.
```js 
      <Hello name={name} age={age} />
```

takeaways:
- props can be passed into components as data.
- pass props into the component tags
- props have attributes
- props can be used to dynamically generate html by evaluating expressions within curly brackets {}
