Defining arrow function syntax
```js
const sum = (p1, p2) => {
  console.log(p1)
  console.log(p2)
  return p1 + p2
}
```

If there is just a single parameter, we can exclude the parentheses from the definition:

```js
const square = p => {
  console.log(p)
  return p * p
}
```

If the function only contains a single expression then the braces are not needed. In this case, the function only returns the result of its only expression. Now, if we remove console printing, we can further shorten the function definition:

```js
const square = p => p * p
```

This form is particularly handy when manipulating arrays - e.g. when using the map method:

```js
const t = [1, 2, 3]
const tSquared = t.map(p => p * p)
// tSquared is now [1, 4, 9]
```

autonomous function takes in argus p1 p2. My confusions is that it seems like it's beter to just define a function name instead. But In a way it's almost like the same since the way you use it would be as followed.

```js
const result = sum(1, 5)
console.log(result)
```


### Original way to define functions
Before arrow function feature was added the only way to define function is using the keyword function

There are two ways to reference the function:

Giving a name in function declaration
```js
function product(a, b) {
  return a * b
}

const result = product(2, 6)
// result is now 12
```

Defining a function expression. No need to define the name of a function

```js
const average = function(a, b) {
  return (a + b) / 2
}

const result = average(2, 5)
// result is now 3.5
```

During this course, we will define all functions using the arrow syntax.


Takeaways:
- defining function using arrow syntax (p1, p2...) => { expressions... }
- To trim it off syntax
	- if the function only takes one parameter you don't need to include the parentheses
	- if the function is only one expression long (the body) you don't need the brackets
- To define a function originally
	- Using the function keyword to give it to a name and invoke the function
	- Defining a function expression so it doesn't have a name and the body is the cody inside the brackets {}
