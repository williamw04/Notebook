The arrow function definition and the function keyword vary substantially with respect to the keyword this. [[this]] is used to refer to the object itself.  For example within an method you invoked using an object you can use this to access properities of the object and the methods.

We can assign methods to an object by defining properties that are functions:

```js
const arto = {
  name: 'Arto Hellas',
  age: 35,
  education: 'PhD',

  greet: function() {
    console.log('hello, my name is ' + this.name)
  },
}

arto.greet()  // "hello, my name is Arto Hellas" gets printed
```

methods can be defined to an object even after an object has been initalized

```js
const arto = {
  name: 'Arto Hellas',
  age: 35,
  education: 'PhD',
  greet: function() {
    console.log('hello, my name is ' + this.name)
  },
}

arto.growOlder = function() {
  this.age += 1
}

console.log(arto.age)   // 35 is printed
arto.growOlder()
console.log(arto.age)   // 36 is printed
```

observe the code below:
```js
const arto = {
  name: 'Arto Hellas',
  age: 35,
  education: 'PhD',
  greet: function() {
    console.log('hello, my name is ' + this.name)
  },
  doAddition: function(a, b) {
    console.log(a + b)
  },
}

arto.doAddition(1, 4)        // 5 is printed

const referenceToAddition = arto.doAddition
referenceToAddition(10, 15)   // 25 is printed
```

the object arto has attributes doAddition and a const variable referenceToAddition can reference the object method.

The intuitive thing is that the variable is storing the reference to the method stored in the object in the scope of object ("this" refers to the object that)
