 Objects can be defined in many ways

### object literals
```js
const object1 = {
  name: 'Arto Hellas',
  age: 35,
  education: 'PhD',
}

const object2 = {
  name: 'Full Stack web application development',
  level: 'intermediate studies',
  size: 5,
}

const object3 = {
  name: {
    first: 'Dan',
    last: 'Abramov',
  },
  grades: [2, 3, 5, 3],
  department: 'Stanford University',
}
```

these properites can be any type and are referenced by using the dot notation or by brackets.

```js
console.log(object1.name)         // Arto Hellas is printed
console.log(object1['name']) // Arto Hellas is printed
const fieldName = 'age'
console.log(object1[fieldName])    // 35 is printed
```

To add properties to an object on the fly by either  by using dot notation or brackets.
```js
object1.address = 'Helsinki'
object1['secret number'] = 12341
```

In the code about the latter call (final line) has to be done using brackets instead of dot notation because the property name has a space in it. secret number is not a valid property name using the dot notation.

Objects can also have methods, but note in this course we will not be defining methods.

Unlike traditional object orientated programming languages javascript does not have classes. There has bee the addition of the class syntax which helps structure object oriented classes. (confusing)

In Javascript however, you can defined objects using constructors, which is like how you would define constructors within object oriented programming.


Takeaways:
- objects can be defined using the project literal syntax or using constructor
- properties of objects can be accessed using dot syntax or square brackets for properities that aren't valid references in the dot notation
- there are no formal classes like there are in object oreiented programming langs
