>docker run --name johnny -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=mysecretpassword -d postgres`

>--name defines the name of the image, the postgres_password is needed for postgresql to run properly, postgres is the default user created alongside the db.

>[!Issues creating a table]
>	With postgresql 15, there's an update with permission i.e revoking all CREATE permission from all users except a database owner from the public (or default) schema
>Note remember that postgresql is a object-relational database management system (ORDMS) not the actual database so you have to create a database first. Which would look like:
>```
>CREATE DATABASE BALLS;
CREATE USER EXAMPLE_USER WITH ENCRYPTED PASSWORD 'Sup3rS3cret';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE ACCOUNT_TRACKER TO postgres;
\c EXAMPLE_DB postgres 
GRANT ALL ON SCHEMA public TO postgres;

Question: What does it mean to map the port of my container to the port of my server. What are ports? Some how realated to network programming

```bash
docker run --name some-postgres -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=mysecretpassword -d -p 5432:5432 postgres
```
^^^ Creates a container named some-postgres using the offical postgres docker  image, with a password connecting the container port 5432 to my server 5432 making  it so now your postgres is accessible from yourÂ `public-server-ip:5432`.
